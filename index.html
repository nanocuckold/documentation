                <p>
                    C#  is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C# was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen, being one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). The most recent version is 9.0, which was released in 2020 in .NET 5.0 and included in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C # was designed as an application-level programming language for the CLR, and as such depends primarily on the capabilities of the CLR itself. This applies primarily to the C # type system, which reflects the BCL. The presence or absence of certain expressive features of a language is dictated by whether a particular language feature can be translated into the corresponding CLR constructs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, with the development of the CLR from version 1.1 to 2.0, C # itself has significantly enriched itself; similar interaction should be expected in the future (however, this pattern was broken with the release of C # 3.0, which is a language extension that does not rely on extensions to the .NET platform). The CLR provides C #, like all other .NET-based languages, many of the features that "classic" programming languages ​​lack. For example, garbage collection is not implemented in C # itself, but is performed by the CLR for programs written in C # in the same way as it is done for programs in VB.NET, J#.

                <h1>C and C++</h1>
                <p>
                    C and C ++ are remarkably similar programming languages, though there are still plenty of differences. C #, on the other hand, has more in common with languages ​​like Java. Here’s an easy guide to understanding the differences between C #, C ++, and C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Object-oriented programming (or OOP) uses a concept called “objects.” An object is an instance of a “class,” or a program-code-template. A class can be made up of data or code procedures (also known as methods).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original C programming language is not object-oriented, which is the most significant difference between the two. C is what’s called a “procedural” programming language, while C++ is a hybrid language that’s a combination of procedural and object-oriented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are other key differences between C and C++.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        C++ was built as an extension of C, which means it can run most C code. The reverse isn’t true though—C can’t run C++ code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As an object-oriented language, C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance, while C does not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In C, data and functions are “free entities,” which means you can manipulate them with outside code. Since C++ encapsulates data and functions together into a single object, those data structures and operators are hidden to outside code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ uses the namespace, which organizes code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions. Name collisions can occur when your code base includes multiple libraries. C does not use a namespace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C uses functions for input and output, whereas C++ uses objects for input and output.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ supports reference variables, which C does not. A reference variable is an alias for an already existing variable, used to create a short-hand notation for faster coding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C does not provide error or exception handling, but C++ does.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>C++ vs. C#</h1>
                <p>
                    As a much more modern programming language, C# was designed to work with the current Microsoft .NET framework in both client and web-based applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While C++ is an object-oriented language, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language. Object-oriented programming concentrates on the associations between classes that link together into a big binary executable, while component-oriented programming uses exchangeable code modules that work on their own and don’t need you to know their inner workings to use them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some other major differences between C++ and C#.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        C++ compiles into machine code, while C# compiles to CLR, which is interpreted by ASP.NET.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ requires you to handle memory manually, but C# runs in a virtual machine which can automatically handle memory management.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C# does not use pointers, while C++ can use pointers anywhere.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ can be used on any platform, though it was originally designed for Unix-based systems. C# is standardized but is rarely used outside of Windows environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ can create stand-alone and console applications. C# can create a console, Windows, ASP.NET, and mobile applications, but cannot create stand-alone apps.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>C vs. C#</h1>
                <p>
                    While C and C# are technically related to each other, they’re enormously different languages, so there are more differences than similarities between them. Having a background in C can be useful for learning C# because some of the syntaxes are similar; however, C#’s syntax is so forgiving that you could easily learn it without knowing C at all.

                <p>
                    A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C# has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory the range of values that can be stored within that memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

                    To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
                </p>
                <code>
type variableName = value;
                </code>
                <h1>Example</h1>
                <p>Create a variable called name of type string and assign it the value "John":</p>
                <code>
string name = "John";
Console.WriteLine(name);
                </code>
                <p>Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:</p>
                <code>
int myNum = 15;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
                </code>
                <p>You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:</p>
                <code>
int myNum;                    
myNum = 15;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
                </code>
                <p>Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:</p>
              <p>Change the value of myNum to 20:</p>
              <code>
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20; // myNum is now 20
Console.WriteLine(myNum);

                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

                <p>
                    In C# you cannot define true global variables (in the sense that they don't belong to any class).

This being said, the simplest approach that I know to mimic this feature consists in using a static class, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
public static class Globals
{
    public static String FILE_NAME = "Output.txt"; // Modifiable
    public static readonly String CODE_PREFIX = "US-"; // Unmodifiable
}

                <p>Constants are constant values ​​that are known at compile time and do not change at runtime. Constants must be declared with the const modifier. Only C # built-in types (excluding System.Object) can be declared const. User-defined types, including classes, structures, and arrays, cannot be declared const. The readonly modifier allows you to create a class, structure, or array that is initialized once (for example, in a constructor) and cannot be changed later.</p>
                    <p>C # does not support const methods, properties, or events.</p>

                    The if statement determines which statement will be executed when the condition specified by the logical expression is met. The following example sets a bool variable of type condition to true and then tests it with an if statement. The result is The variable is set to true ..
                </p>
                <code>
 bool condition = true;

if (condition)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The variable is set to true.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The variable is set to false.");
}
                </code>
                <p>
                    In an if-else statement, if condition is true, then-statement is executed. If condition is false, the else-statement is executed. Since condition cannot be true and false at the same time, then-statement and else-statement of an if-else statement cannot both be executed. After execution of the then-statement or else-statement, control is transferred to the next statement after the if statement.

                <p>
                    The for statement executes a statement or block of statements as long as the specified boolean expression evaluates to true.
At any time in the for statement block, you can interrupt the loop with a break statement, or move to the next iteration in the loop with the continue statement. You can also exit the for loop with a goto, return, or throw statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The for statement defines the sections of the initializer, condition, and iterator:
                </p>
                <code>
 for (initializer; condition; iterator)
    body
                </code>
                <p>
                    All three sections are optional. The loop body is a statement or statement block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following example shows a for statement with all sections defined:
                </p>
                <code>
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

            <article>
                <p>
                    The while statement executes a statement or block of statements as long as the specified boolean expression evaluates to true. Since this expression is evaluated before each execution of the loop, the while loop is executed zero or more times. This is in contrast to a do loop, which runs one to several times.
                </p>
                <p>At any point in the while statement block, you can break the loop using the break statement.</p>
                <p>You can jump directly to evaluating the while expression using the continue statement. If the expression evaluates to true, execution continues from the first statement in the loop. Otherwise, execution continues from the first statement after the loop.</p>
                <p>You can also exit the while loop with a goto, return, or throw statement.</p>
                <code>
int n = 0;
while (n < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(n);
    n++;
}

                <p>
                    A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments. In C#, every executed instruction is performed in the context of a method. The Main method is the entry point for every C# application and it's called by the common language runtime (CLR) when the program is started.
                </p>
                <h1>Method signatures</h1>
                <p>Methods are declared in a class, struct, or interface by specifying the access level such as public or private, optional modifiers such as abstract or sealed, the return value, the name of the method, and any method parameters. These parts together are the signature of the method.</p>

                    <p class="content-p">A return type of a method is not part of the signature of the method for the purposes of method overloading. However, it is part of the signature of the method when determining the compatibility between a delegate and the method that it points to.</p>
